## Testing
This project uses `bats` for testing. On Linux, `bats` can be installed by running `sudo apt install bats`. Use Homebrew to install on macOS. After installing, navigate to the root directory for this project (typically _cp-17-example-scripts_) and run the `test_run` file to test the script. Make sure to run it from `cp-17-example-scripts`.
I'd recommend testing on a virtual machine to prevent damages to your personal device.
